Learning Reflections: Tailwind Footer Styling Project

Overview:

For our project submission, we were asked to style a footer for a web page using the Tailwind CSS framework on CodeSpace.

Reflections:

Areas of Mastery:

Applying Classes: I got good at adding and changing classes in HTML to make things look how I wanted.
Challenges Faced:

Hover and Focus Effects: I struggled with making things change when you hover over them or click on them without messing up everything else.
Areas for Improvement:

Spacing Elements: I need to practice more to make things look nicely spread out and not too cramped.
Design Choices: I want to get better at choosing how things look on different devices and making them all fit together.
Overall Learning Experience:
At first, I was scared of using Tailwind CSS because it sounded hard. But as I watched videos and followed the project instructions, I started to get it. The step-by-step guides were super helpful, especially since I didn't know where to begin. Having some code to start with also made things easier. Now, I'm excited to try more CSS frameworks and keep learning.
